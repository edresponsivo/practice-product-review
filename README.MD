Technologies learned to practice:

- fetch
- React JSX
- React Hooks (UseState() UseEffect())
- Conditinal Rendering
- React Props Deconstructing
- Vite, Git, GitHub, GitHub Pages, GitHub Actions

Notes:
API reference: from 'dummyJSON' using products
https://dummyjson.com/products

Fetch Products from the API, build the array, display the products
Set the Workflow for GitHub Actions to build and deploy to GitHub Pages.

### TODO:

- Create states to be able to remove Products
- Implement the Show/Hide the rest of the Products images
- Create a I Like Button and implement the states
- Save the list locally to localstorage
- Display the Rating stars with SVG Showing what percentage of stars represent.

### Notes:

Remove product button take the product out of the list completed
Images of the product show and hide on demand.
